## Business problem

Mercari is one of the Japan’s E Commerce platforms, which involves selling and purchasing of used/refurbished items.Whenever seller wants to sell an item on Mercari’s app,they want the seller to know what price does this item stands at.This helps the sellers to know the value of the item they are going to sell.
As the price of an item depends on lot of features like brand of the item,what’s the condition of the item…it’s really hard for human to detail all these manually and decide the price of an item.To automate this process using Machine Learning,they created a challenge,where we have to predict the price of item that the seller is going to sell.We will be given the seller’s uploaded data like Item name,Item brand,Item condition..etc.Pertaining to that item and using this data,we have to predict the price of that item using Machine Learning, there by eliminating the human intervention.
## Machine learning problem
With the given details of an item, we have to predict it’s price.This problem can be treated as Regression task,where we have to find the trend of an given series of points using the past data of those points like price in this case.Given are the features of item like item name,item brand…etc. we are going to predict the price of item which follows the trend based on these features.
